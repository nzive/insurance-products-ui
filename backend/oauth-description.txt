OAuth 2.0 Authentication (Simplified Implementation)

This project uses a simplified OAuth 2.0 Password Grant flow.

Hardcoded Credentials:
Client ID: test_client
Client Secret: test_secret
Username: user1
Password: pass1

Authentication Flow:
1. User submits login credentials.
2. Backend validates credentials.
3. Backend issues an access token.
4. Access token is required to call protected APIs.

Secured Endpoint:
GET /api/products

Requests without a valid access token are denied.
